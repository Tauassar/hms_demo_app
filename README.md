# Medical web application for medical workers and patients (Hospital Management System)

Goal of the project is to develop a **Medical CRM** which will solve issues and
flaws of the health system.

Web application is developed using **Python Django** as a back-end service,
and front-end part which was written in **Vue.js**.

Below you could see the ER-diagram of the database, which includes entities like Doctor, Patient, Department, Appointment,
Medical_Status, Prescription and so on.
